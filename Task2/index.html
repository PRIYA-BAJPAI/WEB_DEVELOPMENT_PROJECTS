<!-- Task 2: Show/Hide Sections 
The Scenario: Toggle the visibility of different content sections using dedicated buttons. 
Requirements: 
1. Three Buttons: "Show Bio", "Show Skills", "Show Hobbies". 
2. Three Content Divs: Each has unique text content (initially hidden). 
3. Toggle Behavior: 
○ Clicking a button toggles its corresponding section's visibility independently. 
○ Button text changes: "Show Bio" ↔ "Hide Bio". 
4. Visible Counter: Show "Sections visible: X" (counts how many are currently shown). 
5. Bulk Controls: Add "Show All" and "Hide All" buttons to manipulate all sections at once. 
Concepts Tested: Show/hide elements, button text changes, counting visible elements, bulk 
actions. -->
